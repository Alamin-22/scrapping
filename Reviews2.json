They only have 3 ppl working the place and they all take turns on the clients often making them wait. Each step in the manicure and soak took so long. Now let's talk about the place. So dirty, dirty floors, dirty desks. I had to ask if the manicure instruments were clean and they insisted they were however they were sitting next to the sink not the disinfectant machine.  After i asked a few times, They placed it inside machine for 5 mins and just sprayed them down. I noticed the pedicures sink also is dirty. I did not see any cleaning after pedicures. The lady also tried to convince me to get a 10 min massage after i said no twice. She gave  me minute massage and it was not pleasant.  The colors don't match the numbers either.

The only thing for me was that there was excessive glue on my fingers but i washed it off, no big deal. A few days later i noticed my right middle fingernail started to lift, and after a week it completely came off. Because it was only one nail i didn’t bug about it i called to see if it could get fixed and did so today.i went in and something was off, i’m not sure what. She took me before another client that she had already seated. I wouldn’t have minded waiting and honestly I wish I had. The nail repair was free but i didn’t mind paying, especially because i felt this service was rushed. Compared to my left hand, my right middle finger is shorter in length. I watched her like them up so i’m not sure how that happened. Also, the shape of that nail is not the same as the rest; I always get coffin shaped nails but it looks like the normal square shape compared to the rest. in general it seems like she was rushing to get me out of the chair, even when i left i wished her a wonderful day and was met with total silence. The whole experience left me feeling like I was a nuisance. I really like her work so i’m hoping this was just an off day, this was only my second time coming here.",
