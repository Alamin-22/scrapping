When I confronted Ruma she said that never happened to her and that Im lying to get money because I asked her to fix it she refused and so then I asked for a refund. She was cursing me out over the phone calling me over and over. Most unprofessional dirty and horrible place ever. DO NOT GO HERE"

Additionally, it has been less than a week and all of my nails are either beginning to lift, lifting, or have chipped off. For a gel manicure, this is understandably upsetting.My pedicure, on the other hand, still looks flawless after 6 days. The woman who did them was pretty rough when doing my cuticles and the next days they were a little swollen on the area where it hurt while she was doing it- however they do look really nice!"

I came in requesting a removal of the previous SNS job on my nails from another place which did not last very long before they started to chip and lift. She had me soak my nails and even though she was attending to another client, she made sure to check on my nails often which I appreciated. Once she got started on my nails, she was very gentle and thorough while doing them. I liked that she didn’t rush yet the job was still done rather quickly and the results were beautiful. I will definitely be coming back!"

She started working on me with tools that were just laying there that made me nervous, wiped me with a ripped rag, everything felt old and hadn’t been updated, and they were using this giant brush to wipe off my nail files then used it to clean the table. The prices are good but I got gel and my nails chipped two days after. It’s really disappointing, I think they would be a great salon if they just updated their supplies and were cleaner."

I used to go to another nail salon and I left because my nails constantly kept breaking and making appointments were pointless sometimes.  Ruma is patient and will do the design you ask her if you show a picture. I love that she honors appointments and she is on point about it. Very sweet. My nails never break.  No complaints. Give her a try!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️"

UV gel nails do consume more time so I appreciated how she did take her time doing it. I didn’t like how she took off my my old set of nails, with a Metro Card & it was pretty painful but I let it go. She had a different nail tech start to take my old set off, then she went on to do it herself, which was confusing ,Overall I would come back but I wouldn’t come to remove any old set of nails."

They only have 3 ppl working the place and they all take turns on the clients often making them wait. Each step in the manicure and soak took so long. Now let's talk about the place. So dirty, dirty floors, dirty desks. I had to ask if the manicure instruments were clean and they insisted they were however they were sitting next to the sink not the disinfectant machine.  After i asked a few times, They placed it inside machine for 5 mins and just sprayed them down. I noticed the pedicures sink also is dirty. I did not see any cleaning after pedicures. The lady also tried to convince me to get a 10 min massage after i said no twice. She gave  me minute massage and it was not pleasant.  The colors don't match the numbers either.  First and last time there."

The only thing for me was that there was excessive glue on my fingers but i washed it off, no big deal. A few days later i noticed my right middle fingernail started to lift, and after a week it completely came off. Because it was only one nail i didn’t bug about it i called to see if it could get fixed and did so today.i went in and something was off, i’m not sure what. She took me before another client that she had already seated. I wouldn’t have minded waiting and honestly I wish I had. The nail repair was free but i didn’t mind paying, especially because i felt this service was rushed. Compared to my left hand, my right middle finger is shorter in length. I watched her like them up so i’m not sure how that happened. Also, the shape of that nail is not the same as the rest; I always get coffin shaped nails but it looks like the normal square shape compared to the rest. in general it seems like she was rushing to get me out of the chair, even when i left i wished her a wonderful day and was met with total silence. The whole experience left me feeling like I was a nuisance. I really like her work so i’m hoping this was just an off day, this was only my second time coming here."
