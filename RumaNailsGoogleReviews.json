    "reviewText": "Nails started peeling back that same night. And in under a week they all came off and ruined my nails completely. Iâ€™ve never experienced anything like it. When I confronted Ruma she said that never happened to her and that Im lying to get money because I asked her to fix it she refused and so then I asked for a refund. She was cursing me out over the phone calling me over and over. Most unprofessional dirty and horrible place ever. DO NOT GO HERE"

    "reviewText": "I got a gel french manicure & pedicure, and, while this could be attributed to the way I work with my hands, one of my nails chipped just 3 days later. Additionally, it has been less than a week and all of my nails are either beginning to lift, lifting, or have chipped off. For a gel manicure, this is understandably upsetting.My pedicure, on the other hand, still looks flawless after 6 days. The woman who did them was pretty rough when doing my cuticles and the next days they were a little swollen on the area where it hurt while she was doing it- however they do look really nice!"

I did a gel pedicure and sns manicure, and it only came to 78 (without tip) which is an amazing price for both, especially considering the quality. And Ruma was super sweet, kind and just a pleasure to talk to. I will absolutely be making this my regular spot!"

She is so hardworking, sweet, creative and takes her time even though she runs the whole place herself. She is always down to fix a nail that Iâ€™ve broken and always patiently does my nail art. The prices are the best in the neighborhood as well! I just love her!!Folks are always compliments my nails so you should definitely try her out!"

I HIGHLY RECOMMEND RUMA!!I needed a same day service for an event tonight and remember meeting someone whoâ€™s nails I complimented. She told me about Ruma and I googled the location. Itâ€™s your standard nail salon but with thoughtful, professional service at a reasonable price for perfect nails. I will return! (4-colors, Ruma worked w/ me on selecting the right Reds +1)"
